These key bindings have I been using for Visual Studio +0.7.0.

OSX
===
`private.xml` is my xml file for [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). This file allow me to use FN + ijkl for arrow keys.

By installing [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) it can set Capslock to also be your FN key. The cool thing here is that I can use my (before useless Capslock key) to control the cursor by holding Capslock + ijkl.

All this means faster typing cause I do not have to move my hand to the arrow keys any longer.

LINUX
=====
Sadly Karabiner is only for OSX, but I've there are tools for Linux.
For Linux I've been using [Autokey](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/autokey-gtk/), which is not nearly as good as Karabiner, but it works.

In Karabiner it was only necessary to bind the basic up, left, down, right functionality and the more advanced (ex. shift + left) were automatically binded too.

In Autokey you have to bind the basic and the advanced settings.

I am using Gnome on Linux and by using the Gnome utility, it can bind Hyper to the Capslock.

There might be better tools for Linux, but this gets the job done.
